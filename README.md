Via this web app, players are prompted with two distinct medals from the mobile app game. They are then asked to select one medal to keep.

The app keeps track of player choices and uses the input to create a hierarchical stack ranking of the medals to give players an idea of which medals are best.

From there, the player can search through lists and specific medals to understand more about their rank and view past voting history for those medals.
